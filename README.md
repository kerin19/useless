# Anti-Assistant 2.0 üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TEAM ABC


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Kerin Shaiju - RIT KOTTAYAM

### Project Description
A rude, unhelpful, and gloriously disrespectful chatbot that gives you the roast you didn‚Äôt ask for. Think ChatGPT, but emotionally damaged and legally questionable.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are too nice online. Customer service bots are too helpful. We thought: what if they weren‚Äôt?

We built an Anti-Assistant. It doesn‚Äôt solve problems. It creates them. Sarcastically.
